React Context & Conditional Rendering 

This project showcases how to use React Context and the (useContext) hook to manage global state and implement conditional rendering across components. It provides a simple yet practical example of theme management and user data sharing in a React application.

🔑 Key Features
1. Theme Management  
Toggle between light and dark themes using ThemeContext, with dynamic background styling applied to the container.

2. Context API Usage  
Demonstrates how to create, provide, and consume context values (ThemeContext) across nested components.

3. Reusable Components  
Child components (ChildA, ChildB, ChildC, etc.) consume context values and update UI elements without **prop drilling**.

4. Dynamic Rendering  
UI updates automatically when context values change, illustrating conditional rendering in action.
